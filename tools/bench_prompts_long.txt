Please summarize the following in one concise paragraph, focusing on causes, trade-offs, and practical implications: In a distributed system, timeouts protect latency but can amplify load when retries pile up. If every client retries at the same fixed interval, bursts align and saturate downstream services. Backoff with jitter reduces synchronization, but too much delay increases tail latency and can violate SLOs. When capacity is tight, shedding work early is more stable than allowing unbounded queues. Observability helps distinguish CPU saturation from lock contention, and it is often better to reduce concurrency than to increase timeouts when the system becomes unstable.
Write a clear explanation for a non-expert: A large language model processes input tokens in order. When generating output, it often reuses cached intermediate states to avoid recomputing the full context. This cache improves speed but must be managed carefully, especially when multiple requests are processed at the same time. If the cache is shared without isolation, results can become corrupted. To keep throughput high and responses correct, a system may batch requests, but it must ensure each request uses the correct cached state.
Provide a structured outline with three sections (Background, Key Challenges, Practical Steps) about optimizing CPU inference for transformer models. Mention matrix multiplication, threading, memory bandwidth, and the difference between throughput and latency. Keep it under 150 words.
